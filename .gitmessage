# Normative types:
#   decision(contest)     - Propose a revision to value heuristics
#   decision(bind)        - Make a proposed value heuristic binding
#
# Operational types:
#   align(bet)            - Formulate a bet for aligning better with some set of value heuristics
#   align(specify)        - Create an executable ATDD specification from a bet
#   align(implement)      - Implement an ATDD specification
#   align(reflect)        - Reflect on the validity of the bet and its observed outcomes
#
# Epistemic types:
#   document(<persona>)   - Update recorded knowledge for an audience
#                           Examples: knowledge(developer), knowledge(operator), knowledge(consumer)
#                           Format: As a <role>, I believe <audience> will find <diff> alleviates <painpoint>
#
# Miscellaneous types:
#   refactor              - Restructure without changing observable outcomes
#   chore                 - Maintenance tasks, setup, or scaffolding (use refactor for code changes)
#   misc                  - Escape-hatch for changes that don't fit other categories (requires explanation)
#
# Subject line rules:
#   - Maximum 50 characters
#   - Use imperative mode ("Add registrtion spec" not "Added registration spec")
#   - No period at the end
#   - Capitalize first letter (unless starting with proper noun/acronym)
#   - Remember this is the envelope, the commit diff is **the message**, so don't repeat yourself in the subject line.
#
# Body rules:
#   - Mandatory
#   - Note what, explain why, **don't** recount how
#   - Wrap at 72 characters
#   - Use blank lines to separate paragraphs
#   - Keep paragraphs short and concise
#   - Use bullet points to list items
#   - Remember this is the envelope, the commit diff is **the message**, so don't repeat yourself in the body.
#
# Footer rules:
#   - For align(bet): Reference one or more canonicalized value heuristics with
#       "Refs: decision(accep) <commit-hash>" or "See: decision(accep) <commit-hash>"
#   - For align(specification): Reference bet with
#       "Refs: align(bet) <commit-hash>" or "See: align(bet) <commit-hash>"
#   - For align(implementation): Reference specification with
#       "Refs: align(spec) <commit-hash>" or "See: align(spec) <commit-hash>"
#   - For align(reflection): Reference bet with
#       "Refs: align(bet) <commit-hash>"
#   - For decision(contest): Reference original decision with
#       "Refs: decision(accep) <commit-hash>" or name a prevously uncontested heuristic
#   - For decision(accept): Reference proposal with
#       "Refs: decision(propo) <commit-hash>"
#   - Use blank lines to separate multiple footer entries
#   - Optional for other types
#
# Architectural Reflection:
# This is cheap under high alignment, and increasingly expensive under heterogeneous conditions.
# This is a signal to act, not noise. Re-align, fork or pay the due.
