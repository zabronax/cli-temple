# Commit Message Rules

Before creating any commit message, you must review the commit message template and format defined in `.gitmessage`, along with the current diff set.

Follow that template exactly as the single source of truth for commit message formatting. Do not duplicate or paraphrase the rules here—always refer to `.gitmessage` directly.

And don't guess at what's being commited, verify what's changed.
